# Tetralaterados

Repo to centralise the code done by #TetralateradosTeam for the Drone-Based Tachtical System which can locate any RF source by using advanced drone deployment techniques and multilateration algorithms. Done for the #MyGalileoSolution by GSA.

In /legacy there are some codes that can be used as inspiration (with matching names with needed functions).

The SW Architecture overview can be seen in the following figure:
